The **Agile Manifesto** was created in 2001 by 17 software developers who sought a more efficient and flexible approach to software development. It laid the foundation for Agile methodologies, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and customer-centric development. In this article, we'll explore the principles and values that define Agile.

## **The Four Values of Agile**

The **Agile Manifesto** consists of four core values that guide Agile teams. These values focus on individuals, collaboration, working software, and adaptability. Let’s break them down:

1. **Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools**
    
    * People are the key to success, not just tools or processes.
        
    * Example: A small team of developers working together in a well-communicated environment will outperform a large team using complex tools with poor communication.
        
2. **Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation**
    
    * The primary measure of progress is delivering functional software.
        
    * Example: In Agile, a working prototype or a minimum viable product (MVP) is more valuable than having extensive documentation.
        
3. **Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation**
    
    * Agile values ongoing collaboration with customers to ensure their needs are met throughout the project.
        
    * Example: Regular feedback from the customer ensures that the team builds what the customer actually needs, rather than sticking rigidly to an initial contract.
        
4. **Responding to Change over Following a Plan**
    
    * Agile recognizes that change is inevitable and should be embraced.
        
    * Example: If market conditions shift or new requirements emerge, the team adjusts their approach rather than strictly adhering to the original plan.

## **The Twelve Principles of Agile**

Along with the four core values, the Agile Manifesto includes twelve guiding principles. These principles help teams deliver value continuously and remain adaptable to change.

### **1\. Satisfy the Customer through Early and Continuous Delivery**

* The goal is to provide valuable software early and often, ensuring customer satisfaction throughout the project lifecycle.
    
* Example: Delivering a basic, functional product in the first few weeks, with regular updates based on user feedback.
    

### **2\. Welcome Changing Requirements, Even Late in Development**

* Agile methodologies embrace change and adapt to evolving needs.
    
* Example: If a customer asks for a new feature late in development, Agile teams prioritize flexibility and adjust their work accordingly.
    

### **3\. Deliver Working Software Frequently**

* Short iterations with regular software releases keep the team on track.
    
* Example: A team working in two-week sprints will deliver a working version of the software at the end of each sprint.
    

### **4\. Close, Daily Collaboration Between Business Stakeholders and Developers**

* Effective communication between developers and business stakeholders is crucial.
    
* Example: A daily stand-up meeting where developers and stakeholders align on priorities and challenges.
    

### **5\. Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals**

* Empowering team members to take ownership and responsibility leads to better outcomes.
    
* Example: Providing team members with the autonomy to make decisions fosters innovation and accountability.
    

### **6\. Face-to-Face Communication is the Best Form of Communication**

* Direct communication helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures clarity.
    
* Example: Instead of relying on emails or messages, teams are encouraged to discuss key issues face-to-face or via video calls.
    

### **7\. Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress**

* The true success of a project is measured by its ability to deliver functioning software, not by documentation or plans.
    
* Example: A feature being ready for deployment is the ultimate indicator of progress, rather than the completion of design documents.
    

### **8\. Maintain a Sustainable Work Pace**

* Agile promotes long-term sustainability by avoiding burnout.
    
* Example: Teams are encouraged to work at a steady pace, avoiding "crunch" periods and ensuring productivity is maintained over time.
    

### **9\. Continuous Attention to Technical Excellence and Good Design**

* High-quality code and well-designed systems improve agility and make future changes easier.
    
* Example: Following coding best practices, such as writing unit tests and adhering to design patterns, enhances the quality of the product.
    

### **10\. Simplicity—the Art of Maximizing the Amount of Work Not Done**

* Focusing on simplicity means delivering just enough functionality to meet the requirements.
    
* Example: Instead of over-engineering features, Agile teams focus on delivering only what’s necessary for the current iteration.
    

### **11\. Self-Organizing Teams Create the Best Architectures, Requirements, and Designs**

* Agile empowers teams to take responsibility for their decisions, creating an environment of trust and innovation.
    
* Example: A team collectively deciding how to approach a problem tends to come up with better solutions than a top-down directive.
    

### **12\. Regular Reflection and Adjustment**

* Teams should regularly reflect on their performance and adjust their processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
    
* Example: Retrospective meetings at the end of each sprint help teams identify what worked well and what could be improved.

## **How Agile Principles Improve Projects**

By following the principles of Agile, teams can:

* **Enhance collaboration** between business and development teams.
    
* **Increase flexibility** to adapt to changing requirements.
    
* **Deliver better-quality products** faster and more frequently.
    
* **Improve customer satisfaction** by incorporating their feedback into every iteration.

## **Example in Practice: Agile Project Management**

Imagine you are managing a project to develop a task management app. Here’s how the Agile principles would guide your approach:

* **Iterative Development:** Instead of waiting for all features to be completed, deliver a working version of the app that allows users to create and manage tasks in the first sprint. Subsequent sprints will introduce more features, such as task deadlines and notifications, based on feedback from users.
    
* **Customer Collaboration:** Throughout the project, you engage with stakeholders to ensure that the app meets their expectations, adjusting features and priorities as needed.
    
* **Simplicity:** The initial version of the app only includes basic task management features to ensure that the core functionality is delivered on time. Additional features, such as task prioritization, will be introduced in future sprints.
