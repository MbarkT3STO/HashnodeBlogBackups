# Best Practices in TypeScript

TypeScript is a popular superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. While it can be helpful in improving the quality and maintainability of your code, it is important to follow best practices when using TypeScript to get the most benefit from the language.

Here are some best practices to consider when using TypeScript:

## **Use the** `--strict` flag

The `--strict` flag enables a number of checks and limitations that can help catch errors and improve the type-safety of your code. Some examples of what the `--strict` flag enables include:

* Disallowing the use of `any` types
    
* Enforcing that functions are called with the correct number and types of arguments
    
* Disallowing the use of variables before they are declared
    

To enable the `--strict` flag, add it to the `compilerOptions` section of your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

## **Use type annotations**

TypeScript's static typing system allows you to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This can help catch errors early, improve code readability, and provide better documentation.

Here's an example of using type annotations in a function:

```typescript
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
```

In this example, the `x` and `y` parameters are annotated with the `number` type, and the return type is also `number`. This tells TypeScript that the `add` function expects to receive two `number` arguments and will return a `number` value.

## **Use interfaces for complex types**

Interfaces in TypeScript allow you to define a "contract" for a type that specifies the shape of an object. This can be useful for specifying the types of objects with complex structures, such as those returned from API calls.

Here's an example of using an interface to define the type of a user object:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Smith',
  email: 'john@example.com'
};
```

In this example, the `User` interface defines the structure of a user object, with `id`, `name`, and `email` properties. The `user` constant is then annotated with the `User` type, ensuring that it has the correct structure.

## **Use type aliases for complex types**

In addition to interfaces, TypeScript also allows you to use type aliases to define complex types. Type aliases are similar to interfaces, but they can be used to define types that are not necessarily object-shaped.

Here's an example of using a type alias to define a tuple type:

```typescript
type Point = [number, number];

const point: Point = [0, 0];
```

In this example, the `Point` type alias is used to define a tuple with two `number` elements. The `point` constant is then annotated with the `Point` type, ensuring that it is a tuple with the correct structure.

## **Use type guards**

TypeScript's type system is based on structural typing, which means that types are determined by the shape of their members. This can be problematic when working with type unions, as the type of a value can change based on the runtime value of one of its properties.

To help with this, TypeScript provides a feature called type guards, which allow you to narrow the type of a value based on a runtime check.

Here's an example of using a type guard in a function:

```typescript
function getType(x: string | number): string {
  if (typeof x === 'string') {
    return 'string';
  } else {
    return 'number';
  }
}
```

In this example, the `getType` function takes a value that could be either a `string` or a `number`, and returns a string indicating the type. The type guard in the `if` statement narrows the type of `x` to `string` within the first branch of the `if` statement, and to `number` in the second branch.

Type guards can also be implemented using the `typeof` operator, the `instanceof` operator, or by using a custom function.

## **Use the** `--noImplicitAny` flag

The `--noImplicitAny` flag is another compiler option that can help improve the type-safety of your code. It disallows the use of the `any` type unless it is explicitly annotated.

This can help catch errors and ensure that all variables and function parameters have explicit type annotations, rather than relying on the default `any` type.

To enable the `--noImplicitAny` flag, add it to the `compilerOptions` section of your `tsconfig.json` file:

```typescript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noImplicitAny": true
  }
}
```

## **Use type inference**

TypeScript's type inference system allows the compiler to automatically infer the types of variables and expressions based on the context in which they are used. This can help reduce the amount of boilerplate type annotations in your code.

Here's an example of using type inference in a function:

```typescript
function getType<T>(x: T): string {
  return typeof x;
}

const str = 'hello';
const num = 123;

console.log(getType(str)); // prints 'string'
console.log(getType(num)); // prints 'number'
```

In this example, the `getType` function is defined with a generic type parameter `T`, which allows it to accept any type of argument. The type of the `x` parameter is inferred from the type of the argument passed to the function, so the `getType(str)` call infers the type of `x` as `string`, and the `getType(num)` call infers the type of `x` as `number`.

## **Use type-safe arrays**

TypeScript's type system includes special types for arrays that allow you to specify the type of elements contained in the array. This can help ensure that your code is working with the correct types of data.

Here's an example of using a type-safe array:

```typescript
const numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];

for (const n of numbers) {
  console.log(n * 2);
}
```

In this example, the `numbers` array is annotated with the `number[]` type, indicating that it should contain `onlynumber` elements. This helps ensure that the elements of the array are treated as numbers in the `for` loop, rather than as some other type.

TypeScript also provides a generic `Array` type that allows you to specify the type of elements contained in the array using a type parameter. Here's an example:

```typescript
const strings: Array<string> = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

for (const s of strings) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

In this example, the `strings` array is annotated with the `Array<string>` type, indicating that it should contain only `string` elements. This helps ensure that the elements of the array are treated as strings in the `for` loop, rather than as some other type.

## **Use type-safe functions**

TypeScript's type system includes special types for functions that allow you to specify the types of the arguments and return value of a function. This can help ensure that your code is working with the correct types of data.

Here's an example of using a type-safe function:

```typescript
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

const result = add(1, 2);
console.log(result * 2);
```

In this example, the `add` function is annotated with the types of its arguments and return value, ensuring that it is called with the correct types of arguments and that the result is treated as a number.

TypeScript also provides a generic `Function` type that allows you to specify the types of the arguments and return value of a function using type parameters. Here's an example:

```typescript
function map<T, U>(array: T[], fn: (x: T) => U): U[] {
  const result: U[] = [];
  for (const x of array) {
    result.push(fn(x));
  }
  return result;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = map(numbers, x => x * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

In this example, the `map` function is defined with generic type parameters `T` and `U`, which allow it to accept an array of any type and a mapping function that takes an argument of that type and returns a value of another type. The types of the `array` and `fn` parameters are inferred from the arguments passed to the function, ensuring that the elements of the array are treated as the correct type and that the mapping function is called with the correct type of argument.
