# Introduction to IOptions<T> in ASP.NET Core

One of the key features of [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core is its support for dependency injection (DI), which allows developers to easily manage the dependencies of their application.

One of the classes that is commonly used in conjunction with dependency injection is the `IOptions<T>` interface. This interface allows developers to access and manage configuration options for their application in a strongly-typed manner.

## **How IOptions&lt;T&gt; Works?**

The `IOptions<T>` interface is used to access and manage configuration options for an application. The `T` generic parameter specifies the type of the options that are being managed. For example, if you have an application that needs to access a set of options related to email settings, you might define a `EmailOptions` class to represent those settings and use `IOptions<EmailOptions>` to access them.

To use `IOptions<T>`, you first need to register the options with the dependency injection container. This is typically done in the `Startup.cs` file of your application, in the `ConfigureServices` method. For example, to register `EmailOptions`, you might add the following code:

```csharp
services.Configure<EmailOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("Email"));
```

This tells the dependency injection container to use the `Email` section of the configuration file (e.g. appsettings.json) to populate an instance of `EmailOptions`.

Once the options are registered, you can then inject an instance of `IOptions<T>` into any constructor or method where it's needed. For example, to access the email options in a controller, you might add a constructor like this:

```csharp
private readonly EmailOptions _options;

public MyController(IOptions<EmailOptions> options)
{
    _options = options.Value;
}
```

This will give you access to the email options as a strongly-typed object, which you can then use in your controller's methods.

## **Example**

Here is an example of how to use `IOptions<T>` to manage the configuration options for an application.

```csharp
public class EmailOptions
{
    public string SmtpServer { get; set; }
    public int SmtpPort { get; set; }
    public string SmtpUsername { get; set; }
    public string SmtpPassword { get; set; }
}
```

In this example, the `EmailOptions` class represents the email settings for an application. To use these options in a controller, you would register them with the dependency injection container in the `Startup.cs` file:

```csharp
services.Configure<EmailOptions>(Configuration.GetSection("Email"));
```

And then inject an instance of `IOptions<EmailOptions>` into the constructor of the controller:

```csharp
private readonly EmailOptions _options;

public MyController(IOptions<EmailOptions> options)
{
    _options = options.Value;
}
```

You can then use the `_options` object in your controller's methods to access the email settings.

An `appsettings.json` file typically contains a JSON object with a collection of key-value pairs that represent the configuration options for an application. Here is an example of what an `appsettings.json` file might look like for an application that uses `IOptions<T>` to manage email settings:

```json
{
  "Email": {
    "SmtpServer": "smtp.example.com",
    "SmtpPort": 587,
    "SmtpUsername": "user@example.com",
    "SmtpPassword": "password"
  },
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

In this example, the `Email` section contains a collection of key-value pairs that represent the email settings for the application. The `SmtpServer`, `SmtpPort`, `SmtpUsername`, and `SmtpPassword` keys are used to configure the email settings.

## When to use the IOptions&lt;T&gt;?

You should use `IOptions<T>` when you need to access configuration options for your application in a strongly-typed manner. This can be useful in a number of situations, such as:

* When you need to access a set of options that are related to a specific feature or component of your application, such as email settings, database connection strings, or third-party API credentials.
    
* When you want to ensure that the options are valid before they are used. By using `IOptions<T>`, you can catch errors at compile-time, rather than at runtime, by using the class properties and attributes like \[Required\]
    
* When you want to separate the concerns of different parts of your application. By using `IOptions<T>` you can encapsulate the options for a specific feature or component of your application, making it easier to understand and maintain.
    
* When you need to update the options during the lifetime of the application. `IOptions<T>` is built on top of dependency injection, which makes it easy to manage and update the options throughout the lifetime of the application.
    
* When you want to use the same options in multiple parts of your application. By using `IOptions<T>`, you can share the options across multiple classes and components, which can make your code more reusable.
    

It's worth mentioning that, `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` is an alternative to `IOptions<T>`, it's recommended to use `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` when the options can change during the lifetime of the application.

## **Conclusion**

The `IOptions<T>` interface is a powerful tool for managing configuration options in an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core application. By using `IOptions<T>`, developers can access configuration options in a strongly-typed manner, which can help to catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime. Additionally, because `IOptions<T>` is built on top of dependency injection, it is easy to manage and update the options throughout the lifetime of the application.

It's important to note that when using `IOptions<T>` it's also recommended to use the `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` interface instead, this interface will give you access to the latest version of the options at any given time, it's especially useful when the options can change during the application's lifetime.
