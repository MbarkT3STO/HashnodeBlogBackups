# What is Component Decorator in Angular?

In Angular, the `@Component` decorator is a function that is used to mark a class as an Angular component. It provides metadata about the component, including its selector, templates, styles, and other characteristics.

The following is an example of a component in Angular that uses the `@Component` decorator:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'my-app';
}
```

In this example, the `@Component` decorator is applied to the `AppComponent` class. The `@Component` decorator takes an object as an argument, which specifies the metadata for the component. The `selector` property specifies the HTML element that represents the component in a template, and the `templateUrl` and `styleUrls` properties specify the HTML template and CSS styles for the component, respectively.

The `@Component` decorator is part of the `@angular/core` module, which is a required import for any component in an Angular application.
