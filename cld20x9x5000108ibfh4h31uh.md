# Logging in ASP.NET Core with Serilog and SQL Server

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core is a popular framework for building web applications, and it includes built-in support for logging. However, the built-in logging providers may not be sufficient for all use cases. One popular alternative is Serilog, which provides additional features such as logging to a variety of destinations, including SQL Server.

In the previous article, we had an [Introduction to Serilog in ASP.NET Core](https://mbarkt3sto.hashnode.dev/introduction-to-serilog-in-aspnet-core).

In this tutorial, we will learn how to set up Serilog in an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core application and configure it to write logs to a SQL Server database.

## **Setting up the Project**

First, create a new [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core Web Application using the template of your choice. Once the project is created, install the following NuGet packages:

* Serilog
    
* Serilog.AspNetCore
    
* Serilog.Sinks.MSSqlServer
    

You can install these packages by running the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

```csharp
Install-Package Serilog
Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore
Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.MSSqlServer
```

## **Configuring Serilog**

Next, we will configure Serilog to write logs to a SQL Server database. To do this, we will need to create a connection string that points to our SQL Server database. You can create a connection string by following these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio
    
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance
    
3. Right-click on the "Databases" node and select "New Database"
    
4. Give your new database a name, such as "LoggingDb"
    

Once you have created your database, you will need to create a table to store the logs. You can do this by running the following SQL script:

```csharp
CREATE TABLE Logs (
    Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    Timestamp DATETIME NOT NULL,
    Level VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Message VARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    Exception VARCHAR(MAX) NULL
);
```

Now that the database and table are set up, you can create a connection string in the format of

```csharp
"Data Source=<your server name>;Initial Catalog=<your database name>;Integrated Security=True;"
```

Once you have the connection string, you can configure Serilog to write logs to your SQL Server database by adding the following code to the `Configure` method in the `Startup` class:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // ...
        
        var connectionString = "<your connection string>";
        Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Information()
            .WriteTo.MSSqlServer(connectionString, "Logs")
            .CreateLogger();
        
        // ...
    }
```

This code configures Serilog to write logs with a minimum level of `Information` to a table named "Logs" in the SQL Server database specified by the connection string.

## **Writing Logs**

Now that Serilog is configured to write logs to SQL Server, you can use the `ILogger` interface to write logs in your application. You can inject the `ILogger` interface into your controllers or services using dependency injection, and then use the various logging methods, such as `LogInformation`, `LogError`, etc., to write logs.

For example, in a controller you can use the `ILogger` interface like this:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger<HomeController> _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger<HomeController> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _logger.LogInformation("Home page accessed.");
            //...
        }
    }
```

You can also include additional information in the log by using structured logging. Here is an example of how to log an exception with additional details:

```csharp
    try
    {
        // code that may throw an exception
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while processing a request.");
    }
```

You can also use the `ForContext` method to add additional properties to the log.

```csharp
_logger.ForContext("RequestId", Request.HttpContext.TraceIdentifier)
        .LogError("An error occurred while processing a request.");
```

The log will contain the additional properties in the log message.

## Automatically Create Logs Table without SQL

Serilog provides a feature called `AutoCreateSqlTable` which automatically creates the logging table in the SQL Server database if it doesn't already exist. This can be useful if you don't want to manually create the table or if you are deploying the application to multiple environments and don't want to manually create the table in each one.

To enable this feature, you can pass an additional parameter to the `WriteTo.MSSqlServer` method, like this:

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Information()
            .WriteTo.MSSqlServer(connectionString, "Logs", autoCreateSqlTable: true)
            .CreateLogger();
```

When this feature is enabled, Serilog will check if the table exists in the database when the application starts, and if it doesn't, it will create the table using the following script:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Logs (
    Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
    [Timestamp] DATETIME NOT NULL,
    [Level] NVARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
    [Message] NVARCHAR(MAX) NOT NULL,
    [Properties] NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL,
    [Exception] NVARCHAR(MAX) NULL
);
```

It's worth noting that you need to make sure that the SQL Server user that your application is using has the appropriate permissions to create tables in the specified database.

Also, it's a good practice to make sure that your table structure match the data that you will log, as the script above will log all the fields that Serilog uses by default, but you can customize it to fit your needs.

## Add Custom Columns to Logs Table

You can add custom columns to the logging table and log to them using the `ForContext` method to add additional properties to the log event.

First, you need to add the custom columns to the SQL table, you can do this by altering the table and adding the new columns. for example, let's say you want to add a `UserId` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Logs ADD UserId INT;
```

Then, in your code, you can use the `ForContext` method to add the `UserId` property to the log event.

```csharp
_logger.ForContext("UserId", userId)
        .LogError("An error occurred while processing a request.");
```

Make sure that you are passing the correct value to the `ForContext` method, in this case `userId` should be the value of the current user or the user that generates the log event.

When Serilog writes the log event to the SQL Server table, it will include the `UserId` property in the `Properties` column as an XML string.

You can also use the `Destructure.ToMaximumStringLength` method to customize the maximum length of the string that will be stored in the `Properties` column, this is useful if you want to truncate long strings to save space in the database.

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Information()
            .WriteTo.MSSqlServer(connectionString, "Logs", autoCreateSqlTable: true, columnOptions: columnOptions => columnOptions.Destructure.ToMaximumStringLength(4000))
            .CreateLogger();
```

This will truncate any strings that exceed 4000 characters in length when they are stored in the `Properties` column.

## Add Custom Columns to the Logs Table without SQL

To add custom columns to the `Logs` table without using SQL, you can use the `ColumnOptions` feature of the `WriteTo.MSSqlServer` method as described previously.

Here is an example of how to add multiple custom columns to the `Logs` table:

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Information()
            .WriteTo.MSSqlServer(connectionString, "Logs",
                autoCreateSqlTable: true,
                columnOptions: new ColumnOptions()
                {
                    AdditionalColumns = new Collection<SqlColumn>()
                    {
                        new SqlColumn { DataType = SqlDbType.NVarChar, ColumnName = "UserId", AllowNull = true },
                        new SqlColumn { DataType = SqlDbType.NVarChar, ColumnName = "UserName", AllowNull = true },
                        new SqlColumn { DataType = SqlDbType.NVarChar, ColumnName = "UserAgent", AllowNull = true }
                    }
                }
            )
            .CreateLogger();
```

This will add three new columns to the `Logs` table named `UserId`,`UserName`,`UserAgent` with data type `NVARCHAR` and allow null to the logs table.

## Logging Data into Custom Column

Once you have added custom columns to the `Logs` table, you can use the `ForContext` method to add properties to the log message and store them in the custom columns.

Here is an example of how to log the current user's ID and name into `UserId` and `UserName` columns respectively :

```csharp
Copy code    _logger.ForContext("UserId", User.Identity.Name)
            .ForContext("UserName", "mbark")
            .LogInformation("Home page accessed.");
```

You can also use the `PushProperty` method to add properties to the log message and store them in the custom columns.

```csharp
_logger.PushProperty("UserId", User.Identity.Name);
_logger.PushProperty("UserName", "mbark");
_logger.LogInformation("Home page accessed.");
```

It's worth noting that the property names in the `ForContext` and `PushProperty` methods should match the column names in the `Logs` table, otherwise the properties won't be stored in the correct columns.

You can also use the `Enrich.FromLogContext` method to automatically include the properties that you have pushed to the log message, this is useful if you want to add properties to the log message but you don't have them available when you are creating the log message.

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
            .MinimumLevel.Information()
            .WriteTo.MSSqlServer(connectionString, "Logs",
                autoCreateSqlTable: true,
                columnOptions: new ColumnOptions()
                {
                    AdditionalColumns = new Collection<SqlColumn>()
                    {
                        new SqlColumn { DataType = SqlDbType.NVarChar, ColumnName = "UserId", AllowNull = true },
                        new SqlColumn { DataType = SqlDbType.NVarChar, ColumnName = "UserName", AllowNull = true },
                        new SqlColumn { DataType = SqlDbType.NVarChar, ColumnName = "UserAgent", AllowNull = true }
                    }
                }
            )
            .Enrich.FromLogContext() // <==============
            .CreateLogger();
```

This will include all the properties that you have pushed to the log message and store them in the corresponding columns, you don't need to use `ForContext` or `PushProperty` methods in the log message, you can use them whenever you want and Enrich.FromLogContext will include them in the log message.
