# Implementing IDisposable in ASP.Net Core

One important aspect of building efficient and maintainable applications is proper resource management, which includes disposing of objects that hold onto resources when they are no longer needed. The `IDisposable` interface is a commonly used mechanism for managing the disposal of such resources in .Net applications.

In this article, we will discuss how to implement the `IDisposable` interface in [ASP.Net](http://ASP.Net) Core, with examples and best practices to follow.

## **What is IDisposable?**

The `IDisposable` interface is defined in the .Net framework and is used to represent objects that hold onto resources that need to be released when the object is no longer needed. These resources can include unmanaged resources such as file handles, network connections, and memory allocations, as well as managed resources such as database connections and large object heap (LOH) objects.

The `IDisposable` interface consists of a single method, `Dispose`, which is called to release the resources held by the object. Implementing this method allows the object to be used in a `using` block, which automatically calls `Dispose` when the block is exited. This is a convenient way to ensure that resources are properly released, even in the presence of exceptions.

```csharp
using (var disposableObject = new DisposableObject())
{
    // Use the disposable object here
}
```

## **Implementing IDisposable in** [**ASP.Net**](http://ASP.Net) **Core**

In [ASP.Net](http://ASP.Net) Core, it is common to implement the `IDisposable` interface on classes that hold onto resources that need to be released. These resources can include database connections, file handles, and other managed or unmanaged resources.

To implement `IDisposable`, you need to add the `IDisposable` interface to your class definition and implement the `Dispose` method. The `Dispose` method should release any resources held by the object, as well as call the `Dispose` method of any disposable objects that the object holds onto.

```csharp
public class DisposableObject : IDisposable
{
    private bool disposed = false;

    // Managed resources
    private SomeManagedResource managedResource;

    // Unmanaged resources
    private IntPtr unmanagedResource;

    public DisposableObject()
    {
        // Initialize managed and unmanaged resources
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Release managed resources
                managedResource.Dispose();
            }

            // Release unmanaged resources
            ReleaseUnmanagedResource(unmanagedResource);

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~DisposableObject()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

The `Dispose` method in the example above follows a common pattern for implementing `IDisposable`. The method takes a `disposing` parameter which indicates whether the object is being disposed of or finalized by the garbage collector. If the object is being disposed, the method releases any managed resources held by the object and calls the `Dispose` method of any disposable objects that it holds onto. If the object is being finalized by the garbage collector, the method only releases unmanaged resources.

It is important to set the `disposed` field to `true` once the resources have been released, to ensure that the object is not disposed of multiple times.

## **Using IDisposable in** [**ASP.Net**](http://ASP.Net) **Core**

Once you have implemented the `IDisposable` interface on your class, you can use it in a `using` block to ensure that the `Dispose` method is called when the object is no longer needed.

```csharp
using (var disposableObject = new DisposableObject())
{
    // Use the disposable object here
}
```

You can also use the `using` statement with multiple objects, separating them with a comma:

```csharp
using (var disposableObject1 = new DisposableObject(), disposableObject2 = new DisposableObject())
{
    // Use the disposable objects here
}
```

It is important to note that the `using` statement should only be used with objects that implement the `IDisposable` interface. Attempting to use it with objects that do not implement `IDisposable` will result in a compile-time error.

## **Best Practices for Implementing IDisposable**

When implementing the `IDisposable` interface, there are a few best practices to follow:

* Implement the `IDisposable` interface on classes that hold onto resources that need to be released.
    
* Release both managed and unmanaged resources in the `Dispose` method.
    
* Set the `disposed` field to `true` once the resources have been released, to ensure that the object is not disposed of multiple times.
    
* Call the `Dispose` method of any disposable objects that the object holds onto.
    
* Use the `using` statement to automatically call the `Dispose` method when the object is no longer needed.
    

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your [ASP.Net](http://ASP.Net) Core application properly manages its resources and avoids potential memory leaks or other issues.

## **Conclusion**

In this article, we have discussed how to implement the `IDisposable` interface in [ASP.Net](http://ASP.Net) Core to properly manage and release resources. By following the best practices outlined in this article, you can build efficient and maintainable applications that are easy to debug and maintain.
