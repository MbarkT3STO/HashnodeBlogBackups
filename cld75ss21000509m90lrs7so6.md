# Introduction to Blazor

Blazor is a framework for building web applications using C# and .NET. It allows developers to create interactive web pages using C# code instead of JavaScript. Blazor can run on the client-side (in a web browser) or on the server-side (as an [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core application).

## **How does Blazor work?**

Blazor uses WebAssembly, a low-level binary instruction format that runs on the web, to execute C# code in the browser. This means that the C# code is compiled to a format that the browser can understand and execute directly.

## **Advantages of using Blazor**

1. Familiar programming language: Blazor allows developers to use C# and the .NET ecosystem, which they may already be familiar with, to build web applications.
    
2. Reusable code: Because Blazor uses C#, developers can reuse code across the server and client-side of their application, increasing productivity and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.
    
3. Interoperability: Blazor allows for easy integration with JavaScript libraries and APIs, making it possible to use existing JavaScript libraries in C# code.
    

## **Creating a Blazor application**

To create a Blazor application, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK and Visual Studio installed on your machine. Once that's done, you can create a new Blazor project using the "Blazor WebAssembly App" template in Visual Studio. This will create a basic Blazor application that you can run and modify to suit your needs.

## **Conclusion**

Blazor is a powerful framework for building web applications using C# and .NET. Its ability to run C# code in the browser and its interoperability with JavaScript make it a great choice for developers looking to build interactive web pages. With its familiar programming language and reusable code, Blazor can help increase productivity and reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.
