# Verifying Interactions with FakeItEasy

Test doubles are objects that are used in place of real objects during testing, allowing developers to isolate and control the behavior of specific parts of their code. One of the key features of FakeItEasy is its ability to verify interactions between test doubles and the code being tested.

## **Creating a Test Double**

To get started with FakeItEasy, you'll need to create a test double of the object you want to replace. This can be done using the `A.Fake<T>()` method, where `T` is the type of the object you want to replace. For example, to create a test double of a `CustomerRepository` class, you would use the following code:

```csharp
var repository = A.Fake<CustomerRepository>();
```

## **Configuring Behavior**

Once you have created a test double, you can configure its behavior using the `A.CallTo` method. This method allows you to specify how the test double should respond when certain methods are called. For example, the following code configures the test double to return a specific customer when the `GetById` method is called:

```csharp
A.CallTo(() => repository.GetById(1)).Returns(new Customer { Id = 1, Name = "John Smith" });
```

## **Verifying Interactions**

FakeItEasy provides several methods for verifying interactions between test doubles and the code being tested. The most commonly used methods are:

* `A.CallTo(...)`: This method is used to assert that a specific method was called on a test double. For example, the following code verifies that the `GetById` method was called on the `repository` test double:
    

```csharp
A.CallTo(() => repository.GetById(1)).MustHaveHappened();
```

* `A.CallToSet(...)`: This method is used to assert that a specific property was set on a test double. For example, the following code verifies that the `IsActive` property was set to `true` on the `customer` test double:
    

```csharp
A.CallToSet(() => customer.IsActive).To(true).MustHaveHappened();
```

## **Example**

Here's an example of how you might use FakeItEasy to test a `CustomerService` class that relies on a `CustomerRepository` class:

```csharp
[Test]
public void GetCustomer_ShouldReturnCorrectCustomer()
{
    // Arrange
    var repository = A.Fake<CustomerRepository>();
    A.CallTo(() => repository.GetById(1)).Returns(new Customer { Id = 1, Name = "John Smith" });
    var service = new CustomerService(repository);

    // Act
    var customer = service.GetCustomer(1);

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual("John Smith", customer.Name);
    A.CallTo(() => repository.GetById(1)).MustHaveHappened();
}
```

In this example, we first create a test double of the `CustomerRepository` class using `A.Fake<CustomerRepository>()`. Next, we configure the test double to return a specific customer when the `GetById` method is called using `A.CallTo(() => repository.GetById(1)).Returns(new Customer { Id = 1, Name = "John Smith" });.`

Then we create an instance of `CustomerService` class by passing the test double of `CustomerRepository` as a dependency.

In the "Act" section, we call the `GetCustomer` method on the `CustomerService` instance and store the returned customer in a variable.

Finally, in the "Assert" section, we check that the name of the returned customer is "John Smith" using the `Assert.AreEqual` method and also use `A.CallTo(() => repository.GetById(1)).MustHaveHappened()` to verify that the `GetById` method was called on the `repository` test double.

This test confirms that the `CustomerService` class is correctly using the `CustomerRepository` class to retrieve the correct customer, and that the `GetById` method is being called with the correct ID.
