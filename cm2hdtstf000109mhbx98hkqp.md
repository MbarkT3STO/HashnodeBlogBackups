## Overview

In this article, we will walk through the process of setting up a Svelte project. By the end of this, you’ll have a working Svelte environment on your machine and will be ready to start developing applications.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download the latest version from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
    
* **npm or Yarn**: You will also need npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn as the package manager.
    

## Step 1: Installing Svelte Locally

To start a new Svelte project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Project**  
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    
    ```svelte
    npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
    ```
    
    This command uses `degit` to download the official Svelte project template and sets it up as a new project in the `svelte-app` folder.
    
2. **Navigate into the Project Directory**  
    After creating the project, navigate into the project folder:
    
    ```excel
    cd svelte-app
    ```
    
3. **Install Dependencies**  
    Install all the dependencies required for the project using npm or Yarn:
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    or, if you’re using Yarn:
    
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
    

## Step 2: Exploring the Project Structure

Once the installation is complete, you will notice a basic structure in your project folder. Let’s break it down:

* **src/**: This is where all your application logic resides. Your Svelte components will live here.
    
* **public/**: Contains static assets like `index.html` and other resources such as images and fonts.
    
* **package.json**: This file lists all the dependencies for your project and includes important scripts for building and running your app.
    
* **rollup.config.js**: Svelte uses Rollup as its default bundler. This config file sets up how your app will be bundled for development and production.
    

## Step 3: Running Your First Svelte App

To check that everything is working correctly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This command will start a local server, and you can access your Svelte app in the browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Modifying the App Component

Open the `src/App.svelte` file and you’ll see the default code generated by Svelte. You can modify it and see changes in real-time as the app is automatically recompiled.

```svelte
<script>
  let name = 'world';
</script>

<h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
```

Try changing the `name` variable and see how Svelte reactivity works!
