Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique used to generate HTML on the server, improving initial load time and making applications more SEO-friendly. SvelteKit, the official framework for Svelte, makes SSR simple and powerful. In this article, we’ll cover how to set up SSR in a SvelteKit project, its benefits, and how to integrate it with your Svelte applications.

## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?

SSR involves rendering the initial view of your application on the server, sending fully-formed HTML to the client. This results in:

* **Faster initial page load**: Users see the content more quickly.
    
* **SEO improvements**: Search engines can index the content since it’s pre-rendered.
    
* **Reduced load on client-side resources**: Less JavaScript is needed to render the initial view.
    

## Setting Up SvelteKit for SSR

### Installation

To get started with SvelteKit, you need to install it in your project.

```svelte
npm init svelte@next my-sveltekit-app
cd my-sveltekit-app
npm install
```

### Project Structure

SvelteKit organizes your application into pages and endpoints. The key parts of your project structure include:

* `src/routes/`: This directory holds your pages and API routes.
    
* `src/lib/`: For reusable components and utilities.
    

### Enabling SSR

SSR is enabled by default in SvelteKit, meaning that each page of your application will be server-rendered unless specified otherwise.

## Creating a Basic SSR Page

### Example: Basic SvelteKit SSR Page

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/index.svelte -->
<script context="module">
  export async function load() {
    return {
      props: {
        message: 'Welcome to SSR with SvelteKit!'
      }
    };
  }
</script>

<script>
  export let message;
</script>

<h1>{message}</h1>
```

### Explanation:

* `context="module"`: The `load` function runs on the server and provides data (like `message`) to the component before it renders.
    
* `load` Function: This function fetches or computes data that the component will use when it renders.
    

## Fetching Data in SSR

In a real-world application, you’ll often need to fetch data from an API. SvelteKit makes this easy using the `load` function.

### Example: Fetching Data in SSR

```svelte
<script context="module">
  export async function load() {
    const res = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    const posts = await res.json();

    return {
      props: {
        posts
      }
    };
  }
</script>

<script>
  export let posts;
</script>

<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<ul>
  {#each posts as post}
    <li>{post.title}</li>
  {/each}
</ul>
```

### Explanation:

* **Data Fetching**: The `load` function fetches the blog posts from an API, and the data is passed as `props` to the component.
    
* **Server-Side Fetching**: Since the data is fetched on the server, the HTML is sent to the client with the blog posts already rendered.
    

## SSR and Client-Side Hydration

Once the server sends the initial HTML to the client, SvelteKit “hydrates” the application by attaching the Svelte components to the pre-rendered HTML. This allows your app to behave like a fully interactive Svelte app on the client side.

### Example: Adding Interactivity After SSR

```svelte
<script context="module">
  export async function load() {
    return {
      props: {
        count: 0
      }
    };
  }
</script>

<script>
  export let count;

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<h1>Count: {count}</h1>
<button on:click={increment}>Increment</button>
```

### Explanation:

* **Hydration**: After the server sends the pre-rendered HTML, the button click handler (`increment`) is attached to the DOM, making the app interactive.
    
* **Mixing SSR and Interactivity**: You can combine SSR for initial rendering and client-side interactions after the page loads.
    

## Handling Forms and POST Requests

SvelteKit also allows you to handle form submissions and POST requests on the server, making SSR suitable for full-stack applications.

### Example: Handling a Form Submission

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/contact.svelte -->
<script context="module">
  export async function post({ request }) {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const name = formData.get('name');

    return {
      body: {
        message: `Hello, ${name}!`
      }
    };
  }
</script>

<form method="post">
  <input name="name" placeholder="Your name" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

{#if message}
  <p>{message}</p>
{/if}
```

### Explanation:

* `post` Function: The `post` function handles form submissions on the server. It processes the form data and returns a response that is rendered on the page.
    
* **Server-Side Form Handling**: SvelteKit provides a full solution for handling form data and actions, both on the client and server.
    

## Benefits of SSR with SvelteKit

* **Improved SEO**: SSR makes your content visible to search engines right away.
    
* **Faster Load Times**: The initial page load is faster because the content is already rendered on the server.
    
* **Scalability**: SvelteKit allows you to scale your application with server-side features like data fetching and form handling.
    

## Conclusion

SvelteKit simplifies the process of setting up server-side rendering in your Svelte applications, offering a seamless blend of SSR and client-side interactivity. By leveraging SvelteKit’s powerful SSR features, you can build highly performant, SEO-friendly applications. In the next topic, we’ll explore how to deploy Svelte applications for production.
