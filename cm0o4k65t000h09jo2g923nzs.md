In this blog post, we’ll explore the TreeMap visual in Power BI, show you how to create it, and provide practical examples using a sales dataset. Each example will include results to help you better understand how to use TreeMaps effectively.

## What is a TreeMap Visual?

A TreeMap visual displays data as a set of nested rectangles. The size of each rectangle is determined by a measure (e.g., sales revenue), and you can use color to add another layer of insight. TreeMaps are ideal for visualizing part-to-whole relationships and spotting patterns or anomalies in your data.

### When to Use a TreeMap?

TreeMaps are best used when:

* You want to visualize hierarchical data.
    
* You need to compare the size of different categories within a single measure.
    
* You’re looking for an overview of data distribution and want to highlight large or small segments.
    

## **Dataset Overview**

Let’s briefly review the dataset ([**Download it from here**)](https://y15w7-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/me_mbvrk_onmicrosoft_com/EQ3lhi9e9LRKmRs4kwMFT8cBT4OYU79rqIT5rxFcBk4rrA?e=ncueOT) we’ll use for our examples. The dataset contains the following tables:

* **Customers**: Contains customer information such as ID, name, gender, country, city, age, and marital status.
    
* **Products**: Holds product details including title, category, unit price, weight, and manufacturer.
    
* **Stocks**: Displays current stock levels for each product.
    
* **Orders**: Captures order transactions including customer ID, product ID, quantity, unit price, and total amount.
    

## How to Create a TreeMap Visual in Power BI

### Step 1: Load Your Data

1. **Open Power BI Desktop.**
    
2. **Load your Excel file** containing the dataset into Power BI.
    
3. Ensure that the data relationships between tables (e.g., `Orders` and `Products`) are correctly established.

### Step 2: Create the TreeMap

1. **Navigate to the "Report" view** in Power BI Desktop.
    
2. **Select the Decomposition tree visual** from the Visualizations pane.
    
3. **Drag and drop the fields** into the appropriate areas of the visual:
    
    * **Explain by**: This field will define the categories or groups. For example, you can drag `Products[Category]` here.
        
    * **Analyze**: This field defines the size of the rectangles. For example, you can drag `Orders[TotalAmount]` here.

## Examples

### Example 1: Visualizing Revenue by Product Category

Let’s create a TreeMap that shows total revenue by product category.

1. **Explain by**: Drag `Products[Category]` into the **Explain by** field.
    
2. **Analyze**: Drag `Orders[TotalAmount]` into the **Analyze** field.
    

#### Resulting TreeMap:

The TreeMap will display rectangles representing each product category, with the size of each rectangle proportional to the total revenue generated by that category.

### Example 2: Comparing Revenue by Country and Product Category

Now, let’s create a more complex TreeMap that compares revenue by both country and product category.

1. **Explain by**: Drag `Customers[Country]` into the **Explain by** field.
    
2. **Explain by**: Drag again `Products[Category]` into the **Explain by** field.
    
3. **Analyse**: Drag `Orders[TotalAmount]` into the **Analyze** field.
    

#### Resulting TreeMap:

This TreeMap will display nested rectangles where:

* Each large rectangle represents a country.
    
* Smaller rectangles within each country represent product categories.
    
* The size of each rectangle indicates the total revenue for that category within that country.

### Example 3: Analyzing Product Sales by Manufacturer

Let’s create a TreeMap to analyze sales revenue by manufacturer.

1. **Explain by**: Drag `Products[Manufacturer]` into the **Explain by** field.
    
2. **Analyze**: Drag `Orders[TotalAmount]` into the **Analyze** field.
    

#### Resulting TreeMap:

In this TreeMap:

* Each rectangle represents a manufacturer.
    
* The size of the rectangle reflects the total sales revenue from products made by that manufacturer.

## Tips for Using TreeMaps Effectively

* **Limit Categories**: TreeMaps can become cluttered if you include too many categories. Consider grouping smaller categories into an “Other” category to maintain clarity.
    
* **Use Color Wisely**: Color can be used to add another dimension to your TreeMap, such as indicating performance against a target or highlighting positive and negative values.
    
* **Combine with Other Visuals**: TreeMaps are powerful when combined with other visuals like bar charts or line graphs, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis.
    

## Conclusion

TreeMap visuals in Power BI are a versatile tool for visualizing hierarchical data and comparing part-to-whole relationships within a dataset. Whether you’re analyzing revenue by product category, comparing sales across countries, or evaluating manufacturer performance, TreeMaps provide an intuitive way to identify trends and outliers at a glance.
