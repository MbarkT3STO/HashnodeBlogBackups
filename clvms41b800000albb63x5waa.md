Networking protocols are the backbone of communication in computer networks, facilitating the transfer of data between devices. Understanding the various protocols and their associated port numbers is crucial for network administrators and enthusiasts alike. In this blog post, we'll explore some of the top networking protocols, providing examples and their corresponding port numbers.

## **1\. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) - Port 80**

HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is used for transmitting web pages and other content from web servers to web browsers. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP traffic.

**Example:** When you visit a website in your browser, such as "[http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)", your browser sends an HTTP request to the server on port 80, and the server responds with the requested web page.

## **2\. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) - Port 443**

HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypted with SSL/TLS protocols to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. It is widely used for secure communication over the internet, especially for e-commerce websites and sensitive transactions. Port 443 is the default port for HTTPS traffic.

**Example:** When you access your online banking portal, the communication between your browser and the bank's server is encrypted using HTTPS over port 443, protecting your sensitive information from eavesdropping.

## **3\. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - Port 21**

FTP is a standard network protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It enables users to upload and download files from a remote server. Port 21 is the default port for FTP control messages.

**Example:** Uploading files to a web server using FTP involves connecting to the server on port 21, authenticating with a username and password, and then transferring files between the local machine and the server.

## **4\. SSH (Secure Shell) - Port 22**

SSH is a cryptographic network protocol for secure remote login and command execution. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network, allowing users to securely access and manage remote systems. Port 22 is the default port for SSH connections.

**Example:** System administrators use SSH to remotely log into servers for system administration tasks, such as managing files, executing commands, and configuring services securely.

## **5\. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - Port 25**

SMTP is a protocol used for sending email messages between servers. It enables the transfer of emails from the sender's mail server to the recipient's mail server. Port 25 is the default port for SMTP traffic.

**Example:** When you send an email using your email client, such as Gmail or Outlook, the email is sent to your email provider's SMTP server on port 25, which then forwards it to the recipient's mail server for delivery.
