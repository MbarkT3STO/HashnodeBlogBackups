# Create a Custom Exception Filters in ASP.NET Core

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core provides a way to handle exceptions that occur during the execution of an application. Exception filters are one way to do this, and they allow developers to execute custom logic when an exception is thrown. In this article, we will learn how to create custom exception filters in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core and some examples of how to use them.

## **What are Exception Filters?**

Exception filters are a way to handle exceptions that occur during the execution of an application. They are executed when an exception is thrown and allow developers to perform custom logic, such as logging the exception or returning a custom response to the client. Exception filters can be applied at different levels of an application, including on controllers, actions, and globally.

## **Creating a Custom Exception Filter**

To create a custom exception filter, we need to create a class that implements the `IExceptionFilter` interface. This interface defines a single method, `OnException`, which is called when an exception is thrown.

```csharp
public class MyExceptionFilter : IExceptionFilter
{
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        // Custom exception handling logic goes here
    }
}
```

## **Registering a Custom Exception Filter**

Once we have created our custom exception filter, we need to register it with the application. This can be done in the `Startup` class of the application.

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddControllers(options =>
    {
        options.Filters.Add(new MyExceptionFilter());
    });
}
```

## **Using a Custom Exception Filter**

Once we have registered our custom exception filter, it will be executed whenever an exception is thrown. We can use it to perform custom logic, such as logging the exception or returning a custom response to the client.

```csharp
public class MyExceptionFilter : IExceptionFilter
{
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        // Log the exception
        Console.WriteLine(context.Exception);

        // Return a custom response to the client
        context.Result = new JsonResult("An error has occurred. Please try again later.");
    }
```

## Apply an Exception Filter to a Specific Action or Controller

You can also apply an exception filter to a specific action or controller without registering it in the `Startup` class.

### Using TypeFilter

One way to do this is by using the `TypeFilter` attribute and passing in the type of the exception filter as a parameter.

```csharp
[TypeFilter(typeof(MyExceptionFilter))]
public class MyController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MyAction()
    {
        // Action logic goes here
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyExceptionFilter` will be applied to all actions in the `MyController` class.

### Using ServiceFilter

Alternatively, you can also create an instance of the exception filter and apply it directly to the action using the `ServiceFilter` attribute

```csharp
[ServiceFilter(typeof(MyExceptionFilter))]
public class MyController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MyAction()
    {
        // Action logic goes here
    }
}
```

This way the filter will be executed only for the `MyAction` action of the `MyController` class.

In both cases, it's not necessary to register the exception filter in the `Startup` class. The `TypeFilter` and `ServiceFilter` attributes take care of creating and registering the filter for the specific controller or action.

Keep in mind that in order for these attributes to work, the filter class should have a public constructor, otherwise an exception will be thrown when the filter is created.

### Inheriting from Attribute

Another way to apply an exception filter to a specific action or controller without registering it in the `Startup` class is by creating a custom attribute that inherits from `Attribute` and implements `IExceptionFilter` or `IAsyncExceptionFilter`.

Here's an example of a custom attribute that implements the `IExceptionFilter` interface:

```csharp
public class MyExceptionFilterAttribute : Attribute, IExceptionFilter
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyExceptionFilterAttribute> _logger;

    public MyExceptionFilterAttribute(ILogger<MyExceptionFilterAttribute> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        _logger.LogError(context.Exception, "An error occurred");
        context.Result = new JsonResult("An error has occurred. Please try again later.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyExceptionFilterAttribute` class inherits from `Attribute` and implements `IExceptionFilter`. It also has a constructor that takes in an `ILogger<MyExceptionFilterAttribute>` instance. The `OnException` method logs the exception using the provided logger and sets the `Result` property of the `ExceptionContext` to a new `JsonResult` containing the message "An error has occurred. Please try again later."

Then you can apply this attribute to any action or controller you want

```csharp
[MyExceptionFilter]
public class MyController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MyAction()
    {
        // Action logic goes here
    }
}
```

This way, `MyExceptionFilterAttribute` will be executed for the `MyAction` action of the `MyController` class.

By creating a custom attribute that implements the `IExceptionFilter` interface, we can easily apply the filter to any action or controller without having to register it in the `Startup` class.

You can also create an attribute that implements `IAsyncExceptionFilter` in case you need to filter the exception asynchronously.

## Real-World Examples

### `SqlException` Filter

Here's an example of a custom exception filter that handles `SqlException` and returns a custom response to the client:

```csharp
public class SqlExceptionFilter : IExceptionFilter
{
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        if (context.Exception is SqlException)
        {
            context.Result = new JsonResult("A database error has occurred. Please try again later.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `SqlExceptionFilter` class implements the `IExceptionFilter` interface. The `OnException` method checks if the exception is a `SqlException` and if so, sets the `Result` property of the `ExceptionContext` to a new `JsonResult` containing the message "A database error has occurred. Please try again later."

Then you can apply this attribute to any action or controller that makes a call to the database.

```csharp
[TypeFilter(typeof(SqlExceptionFilter))]
public class MyController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MyAction()
    {
        // Action logic goes here
    }
}
```

This way, `SqlExceptionFilter` will be executed for the `MyAction` action of the `MyController` class.

In this example, the custom exception filter checks for `SqlException` and returns a custom response to the client. This is a useful approach if you want to handle specific types of exceptions in a specific way, for example, returning a custom message to the client when a database error occurs.

You can also apply the filter globally, but keep in mind that it will be executed for all actions, not only the ones that make a call to the database.

### `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` Filter

The following is an example of a custom exception filter that handles `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` when using EF Core. The `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` is thrown by EF Core when there is a concurrency conflict when trying to update a database record.

```csharp
public class DbUpdateConcurrencyExceptionFilter : IExceptionFilter
{
    public void OnException(ExceptionContext context)
    {
        if (context.Exception is DbUpdateConcurrencyException)
        {
            context.Result = new JsonResult("The record you are trying to update has been modified by another user. Please refresh the page and try again.");
            context.ExceptionHandled = true;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `DbUpdateConcurrencyExceptionFilter` class implements the `IExceptionFilter` interface. The `OnException` method checks if the exception is a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` and if so, sets the `Result` property of the `ExceptionContext` to a new `JsonResult` containing the message "The record you are trying to update has been modified by another user. Please refresh the page and try again." and also sets `context.ExceptionHandled = true` to indicate that the exception was handled.

Then you can apply this attribute to any action or controller that makes a call to the database.

```csharp
[TypeFilter(typeof(DbUpdateConcurrencyExceptionFilter))]
public class MyController : Controller
{
    public IActionResult MyAction()
    {
        // Action logic goes here
    }
}
```

This way, `DbUpdateConcurrencyExceptionFilter` will be executed for the `MyAction` action of the `MyController` class.

In this example, the custom exception filter checks for `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` and returns a custom response to the client. This is a useful approach if you want to handle concurrency conflicts in a specific way, for example, by asking the user to refresh the page and try again.

You can also apply the filter globally, but keep in mind that it will be executed for all actions, not only the ones that make a call to the database.

You could also add more logic to the filter to resolve the concurrency conflict, for example by getting the current values from the database and merging them with the values the user is trying to update.
