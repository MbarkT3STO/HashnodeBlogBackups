One of the primary tasks when working with databases is querying the data to retrieve, manipulate, and analyze information. In this blog post, we will explore how to create and execute queries using pgAdmin, a popular graphical client for PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into creating and executing queries, make sure you have the following:

1. **PostgreSQL installed**: Ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed on your system, we talked in the previous article about this: [PostgreSQL: Install](https://mbarkt3sto.hashnode.dev/postgresql-install)
    
2. **pgAdmin**: Install pgAdmin, the graphical administration and management tool for PostgreSQL. You can download it from ([https://www.pgadmin.org/download/](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)).
    

## Creating a New Query

To create a new query in pgAdmin, follow these steps:

1. After connecting to your server, expand the server node in the **Object** browser.
    
2. Expand the **Databases** node, right-click on the desired database, and select **Query Tool**.
    
3. A new tab will open with a text editor where you can write your SQL queries.
