# How To Create an asynchronous function in TypeScript?

Asynchronous programming is a technique that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, rather than sequentially. This can be useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of programs, especially those that rely on input/output operations or network communication.

TypeScript is a popular programming language that is a strict superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing and other features. It also supports asynchronous programming through the `async` and `await` keywords.

In this article, we will look at how to create asynchronous functions in TypeScript and how to use them effectively.

## **The** `async` keyword

To create an asynchronous function in TypeScript, you can use the `async` keyword before the function declaration. For example:

```typescript
async function foo() {
  // function body
}
```

This function can then use the `await` keyword to pause execution until a promise is resolved or rejected. We will look at how to use `await` in more detail later.

It's also possible to use the `async` keyword with arrow functions:

```typescript
const foo = async () => {
  // function body
}
```

# **Asynchronous function return types**

An asynchronous function in TypeScript always returns a `Promise`, regardless of the type of value it returns. For example:

```typescript
async function foo(): Promise<string> {
  return "Hello, world!";
}

async function bar(): Promise<number> {
  return 42;
}
```

In the first example, the `foo` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a string. In the second example, the `bar` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a number.

It's also possible to return a rejected `Promise` from an asynchronous function by throwing an error. For example:

```typescript
async function foo(): Promise<string> {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
}
```

This function will return a rejected `Promise` with the specified error message.

## **The** `await` keyword

The `await` keyword can be used to pause the execution of an asynchronous function until a `Promise` is resolved or rejected. For example:

```typescript
async function foo() {
  const result = await someAsyncOperation();
  console.log(result);
}
```

In this example, the `foo` function will wait for the `someAsyncOperation` function to complete before logging the result to the console.

It's important to note that the `await` keyword can only be used within an `async` function. If you try to use it outside of an `async` function, you will get a syntax error.

## **Handling errors with** `try` and `catch`

If an asynchronous function throws an error, you can use a `try`...`catch` block to handle it. For example:

```typescript
async function foo() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

In this example, the `foo` function will catch any errors thrown by the `someAsyncOperation` function and log them to the console.

## **Chaining asynchronous functions**

It's often useful to chain multiple asynchronous functions together, waiting for each one to complete before moving on to the next. This can be done using the `await` keyword and the `then` method of a `Promise`.

For example:

```typescript
async function foo() {
  const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
  const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
  const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
  console.log(result3);
}
```

In this example, the `foo` function will wait for `asyncOperation1` to complete, then use the result to call `asyncOperation2`, and so on.

It's also possible to use the `then` method of a `Promise` to chain asynchronous functions together:

```typescript
async function foo() {
  asyncOperation1()
    .then(result1 => asyncOperation2(result1))
    .then(result2 => asyncOperation3(result2))
    .then(result3 => console.log(result3));
}
```

# **Conclusion**

Asynchronous functions in TypeScript allow you to perform multiple tasks concurrently, improving the performance and responsiveness of your programs. Using the `async` and `await` keywords, you can create asynchronous functions that can pause execution, return promises, and handle errors.

By chaining asynchronous functions together using the `await` keyword or the `then` method of a `Promise`, you can create complex asynchronous logic in a clear and concise way.
